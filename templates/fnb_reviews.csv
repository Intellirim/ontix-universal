"The truffle mushroom burger at Shake Shack Gangnam is incredible. Juicy wagyu patty with truffle aioli and crispy onions. Perfect for a Friday dinner date. Ordered on Baemin and arrived in 25 minutes. Way better than the McDonald's signature burger.",foodie_seoul,2025-11-20,5,instagram
"Tried the new matcha tiramisu at Starbucks Korea. The matcha flavor is too subtle and it's overpriced at 7900 won. The regular tiramisu at Compose Coffee is half the price and tastes better. Not worth the hype. #cafehopping #seoul",cafe_critic99,2025-11-22,2,tiktok
