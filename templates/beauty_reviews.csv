"COSRX Snail Mucin essence is a game changer for my dry sensitive skin. The snail mucin + hyaluronic acid combo keeps my face hydrated all day. Been using it for 3 weeks and my redness is almost gone. Way better than the Missha one I tried before.",skincare_junkie92,2025-11-20,5,instagram
"Tried the Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum with propolis and niacinamide. My dark spots are fading after 2 months! I have oily acne-prone skin and this doesn't break me out. Bought it on Olive Young for 12000 won. Glass skin goals achieved!",k_beauty_fan,2025-11-15,5,youtube
"Honestly disappointed with Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum. Contains green tea extract and hyaluronic acid but did nothing for my dehydrated combination skin. The texture is nice but after 1 month zero improvement in my fine lines. Switched to Laneige Water Bank instead.",honest_reviewer88,2025-11-18,2,tiktok

"Is the Anua Heartleaf toner really a dupe for Skin1004 Centella Toner? Both have centella asiatica but Anua adds heartleaf extract for extra calming. I have sensitive rosacea-prone skin and the Anua works better for my redness. Available on Coupang and Amazon. #kbeautydupe",compare_beauty,2025-11-25,4,twitter
